# Data Files & Description:
# CountyPopulations.csv = spreadsheet of county populations by year
# (2023 county populations were not yet published at the time of making this project, so 2022 populations were used instead)

# IowaCountiesFoodProgram.shp = shapefile for counties of Iowa, along with attribute table with food assistance rate data appended

# iafoodprogram.csv = spreadsheet of county food assistance statistics. This is already found in the IowaCountiesFoodProgram.shp file attribute table, but I've included it for reference.
